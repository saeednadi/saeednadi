- 👋 Hi, I’m saeed nadi
- 👀 I’m interested in using machine learning techniques for spatial modleing
- 🌱 I’m currently working on deep learning techniques to superresolution air quality simulations!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing an architecture that can be used to accurately transfer outputs of chemical transport models into higher resolution in a computationally efficient way!
- 📫 You may reach me using my email with saeed.nadi@gmail.com
